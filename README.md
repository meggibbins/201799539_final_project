# Does area of greenspace across London boroughs impact the prevalence of mental health disorders?


**Background and context**

Accessing greenspace has been linked to numerous health benefits, including stress reduction, improvements to mood, and physical activity. The World Health Organization have stated the importance of green spaces with mental health, supported also by numerous studies supporting this link (World Health Organization, 2021; Hystad et al. 2019; Callaghan et al. 2021; Zhang et al. 2021). The UK is currently in a mental health crisis, in which there is increasing demand for mental health services but inadequate support and funding and a lack of focus on early intervention and prevention methods. Therefore, it is of high importance to understand the effects of different factors on mental health in order to identify measures to improve mental health outcomes. This analysis is aimed at London, as a densely urbanised region of the UK, thereby this analysis could inform urban planning to improve mental health outcomes here.

**Audience**

This analysis is aimed at public health professionals who would be interested in understanding the impact of greenspace on mental well-being.The analysis could provide insights to develop interventions aimed at improving mental health outcomes in urban areas.


**Aims + objectives**

This project aims to analyse the potential association between area of greenspace across London boroughs and the prevalence of mental health disorders. 

  To achieve this, the following objectives will be met:
- Follow the data science process (data collection, data cleaning, data exploration, data visualisation)
- Produce two visualisations aimed at public health professionals, one spatial and one non-spatial


**Data**

- Area of greenspace comes from the Land Use by Ward dataset from the Greater London Authority, published in 2023. The dataset was accessed via Urban Big Data Centre.

- Mental health data comes from the 'Prevalence of Common Mental Health Problems, Borough' dataset published in 2023 by the Greater London Authority. The dataset was accessed via Urban Big Data Centre.

- London boroughs shapefile came from Greater London Authority's Statistical GIS Boundary Files for London dataset.
